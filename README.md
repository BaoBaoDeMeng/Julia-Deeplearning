## Julia-Deeplearning

[中文文档](https://github.com/tczhangzhi/Julia-Deeplearning/blob/master/README_CN.md)

Collection of Julia implementations of Deep Learning methods varieties presented in research papers. Model architectures will not always mirror the ones proposed in the papers, but I have chosen to focus on getting the core ideas covered instead of getting every layer configuration right. Contributions and suggestions of deeplearning methods to implement are very welcomed.
